# General Todo

---

- Plugin dependency notices (WPGraphQL, currently)

## Dreams

- Auto-rotate the QR code each time someone signs in, rather than use that as the slug, since that doesn't seem to be necessary. That would prevent sharing the URL for "sign me in please, I'm getting coffee" folks. Would require a display rather than printout. Maybe a togglable setting?
